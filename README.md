# MEAN-Portfolio-Project
Here lies the final project for the MEAN Stack course, which is a full stack application built with a Node/Express API and Angular Frontend. For this assignment, I aim to build and application called "My Top 5," where users can search for and select albums to include in their "Top 5" list. Users can subsequently vote on other user's top 5 lists.

## Features
The application will consist of the following features: 

* Users can use sign up and login using the Spotify API
* Users can search for artists by name or genre
* Users can search for albums by name or genre
* Users can create, modify, and delete their "Top 5" list
⋅⋅* Albums are stored in the database once they are selected to a user's top 5 list
⋅⋅* Albums consist of album artwork, title, year released, genre, and the track list including featured artists
* The application will use the Spotify API to pull artist and album data

## Ice Box Features
1. Users can vote on other user's top 5 list
2. Users can make a top 5 list based on genre
3. Users can comment on other lists

## Project Requirements
...*Full Stack Application with Node/Express API and Angular Frontend.
...*Express uses Routing and Middleware.
...*API has at least 3 endpoints.
...*Data stored in MongoDB using either Node Drivers or Mongoose in your API code..
...*CRUD of at least one resource with validations on data.
...*Use of one external API  (ie GitHub).
...*Angular frontend is (mostly or completely) single page and access at least 3 endpoints of the API.
...*Unit and End-to-End testing in your application.
...*Follow best practices, using modules, component based architecture, etc.

The project will satisfy these requirements by leveraging a TDD approach to the application will leveraging a 3rd party API, OAuth, numerous routes and CRUD operations, and storing user data to a database.
